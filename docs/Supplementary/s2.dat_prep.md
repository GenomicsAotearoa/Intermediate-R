# Data preparation

## 1. Prepare working environment

Load required libraries and data.

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    # Load libraries
    library(dplyr)
    library(stringr)
    library(readr)
    library(tidyr)

    # Import data
    asv <- read_tsv("filtered_feature_table.tsv")
    env_data <- read_tsv("sample_metadata.tsv", name_repair = "universal")
    duu <- read_tsv("unweighted_unifrac.tsv")
    dwu <- read_tsv("weighted_unifrac.tsv")

    # Create output directory
    dir.create("./tables/")
    ```

## 2. Clean environmental metadata

There is a block of samples that were originally part of a pilot project. The amount of sample matter collected were insufficient for subsequent chemical analyses. It was retained in the original study as a reference point to determine if there were random effects that would affect the data. For the purposes of a workshop, these samples without chemical data should be removed to streamline the curriculum.

Cleaning tasks:

* Remove samples with NA in chemical data
* Arrange rows based on sample ID
* Convert column names to small letters

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    env_clean <- env_data %>%
      drop_na() %>%
      arrange(Sample) %>%
      rename_with(str_to_lower)
    ```

## 3. Clean ASV table

Cleaning tasks:

* Retain samples based on `env_clean$sample`
* Remove ASVs with row sums of zeroes

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    asv_clean <- asv %>%
      select(ASVID, all_of(env_clean$sample)) %>%
      filter(
        rowSums(
            select(., where(is.numeric))
        ) > 0
      )
    ```

## 4. Clean distance matrices

Cleaning tasks:

* Retain rows and columns based on `env_clean$sample`
* Rearrange rows and columns based on `env_clean$sample`

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    duu_clean <- duu %>%
      filter(sample %in% env_clean$sample) %>%
      select(sample, all_of(env_clean$sample)) %>%
      arrange(sample)

    all(diag(as.matrix(duu_clean[, -1])) == 0)

    dwu_clean <- dwu %>%
      filter(sample %in% env_clean$sample) %>%
      select(sample, all_of(env_clean$sample)) %>%
      arrange(sample)

    all(diag(as.matrix(dwu_clean[, -1])) == 0)
    ```

## Write out cleaned data

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    write_tsv(asv_clean, "tables/asv_table.tsv")
    write_tsv(env_clean, "tables/env_table.tsv")
    write_tsv(duu_clean, "tables/unweighted_unifrac.dist")
    write_tsv(dwu_clean, "tables/weighted_unifrac.dist")
    ```

Also, manually copy `taxonomy.tsv` into `tables/`. 

From now on, `tables/` is the source of data for lessons.
