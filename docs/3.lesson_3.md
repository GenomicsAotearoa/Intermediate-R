# Tidy iteration

## The `map_*` family

Learning objectives:

* Understand the anatomy of `map_*` family of functions
* Understand anonymous functions
* Be able to use `map_*` and its variations for iteration
* Efficiently manipulate list components

In the previous section, we have seen how to use loops to repetitively perform some task. However, there is a suite of functions provided by the `purrr` package that can do just that with less lines of code. These are the `map_*` family of functions. 


## Flexible tables using tibbles

Learning objectives:

* Understand the difference between tibbles and data frames
* Be able to create a tibble
* Be able to manipulate data to create nested data
* Store and manipulate lists within a tibble
