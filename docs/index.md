## Preamble

!!! circle-info "In this workshop, we will be learning a few techniques to achieve the following goals:"

    * Write fewer lines of code
    * Scale analyses
    * Understand how to put multiple concepts together
    * Make code predictable and readable.

!!! bookmark "The topics we will cover here are:"

    [1. Managing and manipulating relational data](./1.relational_data.md)<br>
    [2. Manipulating strings](./2.string_manipulation.md)<br>
    [3. Writing functions](./3.function_conditions.md)<br>
    [4. Using iterations](./4.iterations.md)<br>
    [5. Understanding data structures](./5.data_structures.md)<br>

!!! info ""

Although the lessons are structured in a modular fashion, these techniques complement each other in order to help us achieve the goals above.
