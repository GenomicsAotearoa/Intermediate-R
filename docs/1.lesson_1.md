# Set up

Load libraries and import data.

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    library(readr)
    library(dplyr)
    library(stringr)
    
    asv <- read_tsv("tables/asv_table.tsv")
    taxa <- read_tsv("tables/taxonomy.tsv")
    env_data <- read_tsv("tables/env_table.tsv")
    ```

## Activity aims

* Create a taxonomy bar plot of relative abundances at Proteobacterial class level and phylum level for other phyla

# Conditional statements

Learning objectives:

* Understand the `if...else` construct
* Understand that conditions can be chained sequentially

The anatomy of the `if..else`:

```
if (expression) {

  do_something()

} else {

  do_something_else()

}
```

The `if...else` construct is a way of controlling output depending on a condition as evaluated using the expression inside the `(...)`. In other words, if the expression returns a `TRUE`, it will run the code within the first `{...}`, otherwise, it will run code in the second chunk `{...}`.

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    # Obtain total number of reads for a sample
    num_reads <- sum(asv$AS1A1)

    # Print output if the number of reads exceed 1000
    if (num_reads > 1000) {
      print("Exceeds 1000 reads")
    } else {
      print("Below 1000 reads")
    }
    ```

    !!! success "Output"

        ```
        [1] "Exceeds 1000 reads"
        ```

You can also omit the `else` part if you only want to do something if the condition is `TRUE`. The following statement will provide an output.

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    if (num_reads > 1000) {
      print("Exceeds 1000 reads")
    }
    ```

    !!! success "Output"

        ```
        [1] "Exceeds 1000 reads"
        ```

However, this one will not.

!!! r-project "code"

```r
if (num_reads < 1000) {
  print("Below 1000 reads")
}
```

You can also chain multiple conditions together to generate different outputs depending on the results of each evaluated condition.

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    num_reads <- sum(asv$AS1A2)

    if (num_reads > 5000) {
      print("High biomass")
    } else if (num_reads >= 1000 & num_reads < 5000) {
      print("Adequate biomass")
    } else if (num_reads < 1000) {
      print("Inadequate biomass")
    } else {
      print("Unknown")
    }
    ```

        !!! success "Output"

            ```
            [1] "Adequate biomass"
            ```

When chaining multiple conditions, be aware of the order of the conditions. This is because conditions are evaluated sequentially. For example:

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    if (num_reads > 1000) {
      print("Exceeds 1000 reads")
    } else if (num_reads >= 1000 & num_reads < 5000) {
      print("Adequate biomass")
    } else {
      print("Unknown")
    }
    ```

        !!! success "Output"

            ```
            [1] "Exceeds 1000 reads"
            ```

Note that both the first and second expressions are `TRUE`, but only the first code chunk ran. This can become important if you need to run different code depending on value ranges. Here, the priority of conditions is paramount to how you need to construct your `if...else` statements.
