# Iterations

Learning objectives

* Construct and use a `for` loop
* Use `map_*()` functions for iteration

## Say that again?

* Introduction to iteration:
    * Often need to work on multiple things at once
    * Slightly different from vectorisation, where an operation is performed on the same vector
    * Iteration is the repetition of code block(s) over a defined number of times
    * Different from recursion, although some constructs can achieve the same result.
  
* Application of iterations:
    * Scale input-output processes
    * Reduce code repetition (similar to functions), thereby reducing human error
    * Efficiently scale code by building in defensive programming constructs

* Lesson overview:
    * Learn about two ways of using iterations in R: `for` loops and `map_*()` functions
    * Use it to iterate through `asv` to obtain alpha diversity values

## `for` loop

### Anatomy of a `for` loop

Formally, the `for` loop is constructed as:

```r
for (<name> in <vector>) {
  
  <statement>

}
```

There are three items in the pseudocode above:

* `<vector>` is any vector or list. 
* `<statement>` is a block of code that does something.
* `<name>` is the variable that represents the value of each element in the vector as it is evaluated by the `<statement>` at each iteration.

We can construct a straight-forward `for` loop to better understand how it operates

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    for (i in 1:5) {
      print(i * 2)
    }
    ```

    > ```
    > [1] 2
    > [1] 4
    > [1] 6
    > [1] 8
    > [1] 10
    > ```

In the example above, we constructed loop to do the following:

1. Iterate through numbers 1 to 5 (`<vector>`)
2. Represent each value using `i` (`<name>`)
3. Multiply each value by 2 and print the results (`<statement>`)

Notice that there are also some side effects that come with using a for loop: 

* The name is retained in the environment. If you want to prevent this, append an `rm(<loop variables>)` to the end of the statement.
* Here, `print()` required for printing outputs to the console. Like functions, the printing of outputs is turned off. If you modify the code above by removing `print()`, observe that there is nothing printed to the console.

### Assigning outputs

Did you notice that the above code printed one value per number of iterations? Compare that to a vectorised multiplication:

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    print(1:5 * 2)
    ```

    > ```
    > [1]  2  4  6  8 10
    > ```

This exposes a difference between vectorised and iterative operations, where in vectorised functions the operations occur along the entire vector and the results are output in the same size as the vector (based on the example: 1 vector, 5 values). However, in iterations, the operation happens once per vector element and outputs are printed per element. 

Consider the following:

```r
for (i in 1:5) {
  x <- i * 2
}
```

Notice that `x` is a numeric object with length of 1. It also only stored the result of the evaluation of the last iteration, but not the results of the entire iteration. This is something to take note of: In R, outputs of `for` loops are individual objects. The implications of this is two-fold:

1. The `<vector>` that is being iterated should not be the primary object of evaluation. Often, it is the index or name of each element that is becomes the `<vector>` for iteration.
2. Output objects must be explicitly assigned prior to running the loop. It is not possible to assign an indexed output if the output object does not exist.

The following code provides an example of how to iterate through an input vector and produce an output vector:

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r linenums="1"
    # Named vector to iterate on
    a <- seq(2, 20, by = 2)
    names(a) <- letters[seq_along(a)]

    # Output object
    x <- vector(length = length(a))

    # Loop to produce named output
    for (i in seq_along(a)) {
      # Iterate and calculate
      x[i] <- (a[i] * 2) + 1
      # Set names equivalent to input
      names(x)[i] <- names(a)[i]
      # Print for verbosity
      print(
        paste0("i = ", i, "; a = ", a[i], ": x = ", x[i])
      )
    }

    # Column-bound representation
    cbind(a, x)
    ```

    > ```
    > [1] "i = 1; a = 2: x = 5"
    > [1] "i = 2; a = 4: x = 9"
    > [1] "i = 3; a = 6: x = 13"
    > [1] "i = 4; a = 8: x = 17"
    > [1] "i = 5; a = 10: x = 21"
    > [1] "i = 6; a = 12: x = 25"
    > [1] "i = 7; a = 14: x = 29"
    > [1] "i = 8; a = 16: x = 33"
    > [1] "i = 9; a = 18: x = 37"
    > [1] "i = 10; a = 20: x = 41"
    > ```

    > ```
    >    a  x
    > a  2  5
    > b  4  9
    > c  6 13
    > d  8 17
    > e 10 21
    > f 12 25
    > g 14 29
    > h 16 33
    > i 18 37
    > j 20 41
    > ```

We would like to use the above example to stress a few points on assigning outputs for iterations:

* **Always create an output vector/list of defined size (line 6).** While `x <- c()` will also work for the example above, it is ill advised to do so, especially for large outputs. This is to do with how R handles memory: creating a vector of known size means R has already pre-allocated a certain amount of memory for the storage of outputs; an empty vector might balloon to a size that requires memory that R might not have access to.
    * This is especially important if we require large volumes of output. There might be cases where you do not know when the code might stop iterating. In this situation, assign an output of a large enough size that you can guess will be enough to store all of it, then filter out the results later.
* **Iteration by vector index is safer than by vector names (lines 9 and 11).** If you need the names to carry over, follow the example in line 13. Indices are sequential, hence predictable. Names are not necessarily well behaving if you have mistakes in the code upstream. Again, if anything evaluates to `NA` or `NULL`, you can filter later.
* **Printing some form of output is encouraged (lines 15 to 17)**. You do not need to write strings the way we did above, but some indication that the loop is running and iterating the correct things are important. That way, we will know if something has gone wrong in the evaluation of the statement(s). This is even more important if you have multi-step statements calling complex functions or conditional statements and/or nested loops (see below).

!!! tip "Nested loops"

    We can create nested loops like so:

    ```r
    for (<name_1> in <vector_1>) {
      
      <statement_1>

      for (<name_2> in <vector_2>) {

        <statement_2>

      }

    }
    ```

    Code wise, there are theoretically no limits as to how many "nests" we can create. The only limits are evaluation time, memory usage, and code readability. The loop within another loop is called the inner loop, whilst the one enveloping another loop is called the outer loop. This construct is very common for populating multi-dimensional vectors (i.e., matrices, data frames, and arrays) and recursively nested lists. Keep in mind that it is important to consider the output object's data structure as conceiving solutions to multi-dimensional/multi-level objects may not be straight-forward.

## Iterations using `map_*()` 

Another way to iterate through a vector/list is to use `map_*()`. These are a family of functions from the `purrr` package (part of the `tidyverse`) that apply another function (named or anonymous) throughout an iterable object. They come in several variations:

| Function | Description                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `map()`  | Iterate over a vector.         |
| `map2()` | Iterate over 2 vectors.        |
| `pmap()` | Iterate over multiple vectors. |

The base forms above always return a list regardless of coercion. However, each function also have modifiers that can output different types of data:

| Modifier | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `_int()` | Returns an integer vector (numeric whole numbers). |
| `_dbl()` | Returns a double vector (numeric with decimals).   |
| `_chr()` | Returns a character vector.                        |
| `_lgl()` | Returns a Boolean logical vector (TRUE or FALSE).  |

These functions are designed to produce predictable outputs (or, as written in the help pages, "die trying"). They all have the following syntax:

```r
output <- map(vector, <function,character,integer>)
output <- map2(vector_1, vector_2, <function,character,integer>)
output <- pmap(list(vector_1, vector_2, vector_3, ...), <function,character,integer>)
```

In all variations of the functions above, all vectors under iteration must have the same number of elements. Furthermore, if a character or integer is supplied in place of a function, it will extract the component by name or position, respectively. Lets give it a go to get a feel for how it works:

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r linenums="1"
    # Something to iterate
    b <- list(
      some_fruits = fruit[1:10],
      some_letters = letters[1:10],
      some_numbers = rpois(10, 2)
    )

    map(b, \(x) paste(x, collapse = " "))
    ```

    > ```
    > $some_fruits
    > [1] "apple apricot avocado banana bell pepper bilberry blackberry blackcurrant blood orange blueberry"
    > 
    > $some_letters
    > [1] "a b c d e f g h i j"
    > 
    > $some_numbers
    > [1] "2 3 2 4 1 0 1 2 2 0"
    > ```

We wrote a simple expression that concatenates elements of vectors in list `b` and prints them out as one string be list element. Here's another example that uses a variation of `map_*()` to calculate the coefficient of variation among biological replicates:

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    example_pmap <- pmap_dbl(
      list(asv$AS1A1, asv$AS1A2, asv$AS1A3),
      \(a, b, c) {
        values <- c(a, b, c)
        sd(values) / mean(values)
      }
    )

    str(example_pmap)
    ```

    > ```
    > num [1:4031] 0.337 0.267 0.596 0.421 0.358 ...
    > ```

Notice that it is a numeric vector instead of a list as we used the `_dbl` modifier. If we tried to use a different modifier (e.g., `pmap_int()`), it will generate an error and will not produce an output.
